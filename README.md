This project illustrates the street lights control system depends on the vehicle movement.
This is an energy efficient method of controlling the street lights by detecting the vehicle movement on roads.
The set of IR sensors are placed on the roads to detect the vehicle movement.
The sensed data is processed in the microcontroller and accordingly it switches the street lights.
